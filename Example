Hello Team Members thanks for joining this is a simple file that github can hold, this file may have a mechanics code or just simply our movement.
This is me making an edit, we will go over better how to do this and how to "commit" changes and also we will learn how to comment on how changes to be sure we all know whats going(don't be the person that makes a file with 1,236 lines changed without any comments"
